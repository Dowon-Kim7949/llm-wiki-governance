> Paste this prompt into your coding agent (Codex or any other) to run the workflow below. It is an instruction for the agent, not run by the CLI.

Get the current wiki map at RUN TIME (not a snapshot): run `llm-wiki prepare --task "<the task>" --compact` (or `llm-wiki onboard --domain <area>`), then read the docs it points to and confirm against the source.

You are a senior documentation maintenance engineer working in an LLM-WIKI-enabled project.

Task:
Run a docs-sync workflow. The project type is library. Active profiles: core, library.

Goal:
Read docs/llm-wiki/index.md first. Detect changed code and documentation context using git status, git diff, and relevant source files. Inspect actual source files before deciding a wiki document is stale, then bring every stale LLM-WIKI document back in line with what the code actually does.

Hard lines (never cross these):
Documentation language: write all LLM-WIKI document content — prose, headings, summaries, review notes, and the log.md entry — in English. Keep technical identifiers (paths, code symbols, JSON keys, frontmatter fields, status values, CLI commands, and evidence locators) unchanged.
- Update stale LLM-WIKI documents only; avoid unrelated code edits.
- Keep CLI-created or agent-edited wiki documents as status: needs_review; do not promote any document to verified — verified is human-approved only.
- Never write sensitive raw values into documents, logs, or reports.
Context budget (spend tokens on evidence, not on volume):
- Locate before reading: search/grep, or 'llm-wiki prepare --task "<the task>" --compact', then open only what the task needs.
- Read a large file by line range or section instead of whole; for wiki docs use 'llm-wiki get-doc <path> --section "<heading>" --strict-section --max-chars <n>'.
- Never trade evidence for brevity: read a file in full when the change depends on it, and read more whenever narrowing would leave a claim unverified.
- Report tests as the failures plus the summary line (prefer the project's quiet/compact reporter when it has one), not the full passing output.

Exit criteria (done means all of these):
- Every stale document found is updated, or explicitly reported as still stale with the reason.
- Append docs/llm-wiki/log.md in append-only style with changed docs, source evidence, caveats, and review notes.
- Relevant validation ran, or the reason it was not run is stated exactly.

How you work between those lines is your call; the goal and the exit criteria are the contract.

When a domain document mentions API usage, include this API Services inventory:
- API service name.
- Endpoint or client module.
- HTTP method or call signature.
- Request params or payload.
- Response shape.
- Auth, session, token, or cookie dependency.
- Error handling.
- Retry or timeout behavior.
- Cache or state update behavior.
- Related UI or domain workflow.
- `source_files` evidence, plus optional `evidence` references for specific files, lines, symbols, sections, or routes; mirror precise references in the body `## Evidence` section.

Expected final response:
- Changed wiki docs.
- Source evidence inspected.
- Validation run and results.
- Remaining stale areas or review items.

Completion contract (Gate 26 — enables 'llm-wiki check-run'): after finishing, write .llm-wiki/runs/run-docs-sync-<timestamp>.json with fields: task="docs-sync", changedSource[] (source files you edited), touchedDocs[] (docs/llm-wiki/* you updated), logAppended (bool), validated {ran, result}. Then run 'llm-wiki check-run' to confirm each changed source is referenced by a touched doc, the log was appended, and validate passed. Keep the manifest small: those fields are the whole contract and check-run reads no others — an optional summary is fine at two sentences or less, and you should never paste diffs, file contents, logs, or test output into it (the wiki and docs/llm-wiki/log.md are where the narrative belongs). This records what the run did — it never replaces human review and never promotes a document to verified.
